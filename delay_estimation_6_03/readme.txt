This package demonstrates a number of delay estimation techniques for periodic signals.

Two examples are provided:
simple_example.m demonstrates a number of methods on a single signal
compare_delay_methods_6_03.m compares a number of methods over a range of signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequency contents. This file will take hours to run, if you want quicker results, set N_repeats=30, N_SNR=10, N_fc=10.

A paper is in progress with further details.  Please send an email to travis.mlfx@nutaksas.com to request a draft/preprint, or to be notified when it is published.
